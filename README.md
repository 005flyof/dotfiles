# 005flyof's dotfiles

## Install script

The script `install.sh` can be called to create symlinks to dotfiles in this repository.
It will save your existing dotfiles in the `$olddir` in the repository (which is unversionned).
The `$dir` variable explains where the repo is living.

You can launch it by using:

- `./install.sh` => all the dotfiles of the repository will be symlinked
- `./install.sh file1 file2` => only `file1` and `file2` will be symlinked
